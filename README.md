## Design System with React

This is a short project for educational purposes. Here I built a design system with Figma and React, it helps a lot to create patterns and to build an agile culture to the frontend development team. I utilized the Figma styleguide to build the React components and added it into a Storybook, where you can see the components as it exists on React with a simple design view. I also created a CI/CD pipeline with Github Actions to deploy the Storybook as a Github Page.

In this project, I used the following technologies:

 - Figma
 - React
 - Vite
 - Storybook
 - Radix UI
 - TailwindCSS
 - Github Actions
 - Github Pages
